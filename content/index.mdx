Dunner is a container based task runner tool built in Golang using Docker’s client library. A user
can define multiple tasks, each task with some sequential steps which run on separate
containers. Salient features are as follows,

- Easy to write YAML task file
- A test run mode, viz., Dry run
- Passing arguments through cli
- Exporting environment variables from the host or .env file
- Mounting external directories as bind volumes
- Concurrent execution of tasks by choice

... and many more to come.

## Why Docker?
Docker has proven to be a great utility tool when talked about the DevOps existing in the
current trend of software development. It’s open source, easy-to-use, reliable and reduces
system dependencies on a very large scale. The motivation in choosing Docker as the backbone
of a task-runner is that no dependencies are being installed on the host directly, and no
execution process interacts with host at core-level. This increases system security such that
whatever be the process, it gets executed in the container itself. Therefore, if the process is
meant to harm the system, only that specific container will get affected, not the host.
